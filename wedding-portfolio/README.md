This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

//This app contains two user types. A wedding planner (who has the ability to log in) and a single user (no need to log in so no need for user data to be persisted on this user type) who can view portfolios.
*Onboarding process for wedding planner. Include their location and contact info for people to reach them.
*Login Page - After a user logs in, they'll be directed to their portfolio page where they can view what they have posted. They can also click to edit or delete posts.
*Navigation - Navigation is present on all pages, Users should know what page is active by clicking on a nav link and activating their tab.
*Create Post Page - Allows a user to come in and create a post of a wedding. Each post needs to have an image, description, wedding location, wedding theme, and list of vendors they managed.  (You can hard code the image in for MVP-no need to upload photos for MVP. Stretch goals will include image uploading and the use of Cloudinary API etc. )
*Home Page for non-logged in users - Navigating to the home page Users can view posts of different wedding planners laid out in a single format. Users can click on a single post to read more of the description etc. They can filter by planner name, location, or theme.
